# SIGEAF
Special Interest Group For Emerging Abilities in Foundation Models

This is an open repository for collecting and following reasearch about 
both **theoritical analysis** and **empirical analysis** on emerging abilities 
shows in foundation models (for now, most of the are Large Language Models) at the moment.

In the future, our group members may consider to found an academic conference Named SIGEAF,
and its branche **SIGTEAF** (Special Interest Group For Theoritical analysis on Emerging Abilities in Foundation Models)
especially considering for now, most of orginazations(e.g. universities, common techs..) do not have sufficent GPUs to 
study about emerging abilities. Theoritical analysis and simulation research would be a reasonable direction for the future..
